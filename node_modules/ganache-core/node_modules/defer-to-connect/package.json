It'll do that for you.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst deferToConnect = require('defer-to-connect');\r\n\r\ndeferToConnect(socket, () => {\r\n    console.log('Connected!');\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\n### deferToConnect(socket, fn)\r\n\r\nCalls `fn()` when connected.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n",
